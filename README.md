#What?
This is a desktop wallpaper switcher, which displays text in the middle of the screen, and switches them out every n seconds. It is in its primitive stage.

#Usage:
Fill in a text file, with each quote/tip/trick on a separate line, and pass it as an argument while running the Bash file.

#Screenshots:
Works wonderfully in DWM.
